# Overview  
This project is an AI-powered agent designed to summarize clinical notes. The agent leverages Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) and A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols, and integrates with Gemma running locally for advanced language processing. The agent is accessible via a React web application, allowing clinicians to input free-text notes and receive concise, accurate summaries. This solution streamlines clinical documentation, reduces cognitive load, and improves information retrieval for healthcare professionals.

# Core Features  
- **Clinical Note Summarization**: Accepts raw clinical notes and returns a concise summary using Gemma's LLM capabilities.
- **React Web Application**: User-friendly frontend for clinicians to submit notes and view summaries.
- **ADK & A2A Integration**: Agent is built using Google ADK and communicates via A2A for modularity and extensibility.
- **Local Gemma Integration**: Utilizes a locally running Gemma instance for privacy and performance.
- **API Layer**: Secure API endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
- **Audit Logging**: Tracks summarization requests and responses for compliance.

# User Experience  
- **User Personas**: Clinicians, medical scribes, and healthcare IT staff.
- **Key User Flows**: 
  1. Clinician logs in to the web app.
  2. Pastes or uploads clinical notes.
  3. Submits for summarization.
  4. Receives and reviews the summary.
  5. Optionally downloads or copies the summary.
- **UI/UX Considerations**: Simple, accessible interface; clear feedback on processing status; strong privacy messaging.

# Technical Architecture  
- **Frontend**: React web application (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Java or Python service using Google ADK and A2A
- **Gemma Integration**: Local Gemma LLM instance, accessed via API or direct SDK
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for note submission and summary retrieval
- **Security**: Local-only access, authentication for web app, audit logging
- **Deployment**: Dockerized services for easy local setup

# Development Roadmap  
- **MVP Requirements**:
  - Set up React frontend for note input and summary display
  - Implement backend agent using ADK and A2A
  - Integrate with local Gemma instance
  - Build REST API for frontend-backend communication
  - Add basic authentication and audit logging
- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Support for batch summarization
  - Role-based access control
  - Advanced analytics and reporting
  - Integration with EHR systems

# Logical Dependency Chain
- Backend agent foundation (ADK/A2A)
- Gemma integration
- REST API
- Frontend React app
- Authentication & audit logging
- Enhancements (batch, RBAC, analytics)

# Risks and Mitigations  
- **Gemma integration complexity**: Mitigate by starting with simple API calls, then optimizing.
- **Data privacy**: Ensure all processing is local, use strong authentication.
- **Clinical accuracy**: Validate summaries with real clinical data and user feedback.
- **User adoption**: Engage clinicians early for feedback and usability testing.
